// IMPORTANT NOTE TO SELF: Go back to COMMITTING IMMEDIATELY after each function: so you do not lose your work, by accidental deletes, computer issues, etc.!  YOU'RE NEW TO THIS; and it's OKAY- who cares if more experience developers do not overly commit- YOU HAVE TO DO WHAT WORKS BEST FOR YOU; SO DO IT, AND DO IT GREAT!!! //
